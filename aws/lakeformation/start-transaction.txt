START-TRANSACTION()                                        START-TRANSACTION()



NAME
       start-transaction -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  a  new  transaction and returns its transaction ID. Transaction
       IDs are opaque objects that you can use to identify a transaction.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-transaction
          [--transaction-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transaction-type (string)
          Indicates whether this transaction should be read only or  read  and
          write.  Writes  made  using  a  read-only transaction ID will be re-
          jected. Read-only transactions do not need to be committed.

          Possible values:

          o READ_AND_WRITE

          o READ_ONLY

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TransactionId -> (string)
          An opaque identifier for the transaction.
