GET-QUERY-STATE()                                            GET-QUERY-STATE()



NAME
       get-query-state -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the state of a query previously submitted. Clients are expected
       to poll GetQueryState to monitor the current state of the planning  be-
       fore  retrieving  the  work units. A query state is only visible to the
       principal that made the initial call to StartQueryPlanning .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-query-state
          --query-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --query-id (string)
          The ID of the plan query operation.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Error -> (string)
          An error message when the operation fails.

       State -> (string)
          The state of a query previously submitted. The possible states are:

          o PENDING: the query is pending.

          o WORKUNITS_AVAILABLE:  some  work units are ready for retrieval and
            execution.

          o FINISHED: the query planning finished successfully, and  all  work
            units are ready for retrieval and execution.

          o ERROR:  an error occurred with the query, such as an invalid query
            ID or a backend error.
