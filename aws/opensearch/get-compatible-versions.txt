GET-COMPATIBLE-VERSIONS()                            GET-COMPATIBLE-VERSIONS()



NAME
       get-compatible-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of upgrade-compatible versions of OpenSearch/Elastic-
       search. You can optionally pass a ``  DomainName  ``  to  get  all  up-
       grade-compatible versions of OpenSearch/Elasticsearch for that specific
       domain.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-compatible-versions
          [--domain-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of an domain. Domain names are unique  across  the  domains
          owned  by an account within an AWS region. Domain names start with a
          letter or number and can contain the following characters: a-z (low-
          ercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CompatibleVersions -> (list)
          A map of compatible OpenSearch versions returned as part of  the  ``
          GetCompatibleVersions `` operation.

          (structure)
              A  map  from  an ``  EngineVersion `` to a list of compatible ``
              EngineVersion `` s to which the domain can be upgraded.

              SourceVersion -> (string)
                 The current version of OpenSearch a domain is on.

              TargetVersions -> (list)
                 List of supported OpenSearch versions.

                 (string)
