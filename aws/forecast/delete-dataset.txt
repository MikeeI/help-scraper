DELETE-DATASET()                                              DELETE-DATASET()



NAME
       delete-dataset -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an Amazon Forecast dataset that was created using the  Create-
       Dataset operation. You can only delete datasets that have a  status  of
       ACTIVE  or  CREATE_FAILED  . To get the status use the  DescribeDataset
       operation.

       NOTE:
          Forecast does not automatically update any dataset groups that  con-
          tain  the deleted dataset. In order to update the dataset group, use
          the operation, omitting the deleted dataset's ARN.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-dataset
          --dataset-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dataset-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
