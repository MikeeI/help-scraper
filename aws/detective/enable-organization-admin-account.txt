NAME
       enable-organization-admin-account -

DESCRIPTION
       Designates  the Detective administrator account for the organization in
       the current Region.

       If the account does not have Detective enabled, then enables  Detective
       for that account and creates a new behavior graph.

       Can only be called by the organization management account.

       The  Detective  administrator  account  for an organization must be the
       same in all Regions. If you already designated a Detective  administra-
       tor  account  in  another  Region, then you must designate the same ac-
       count.

SYNOPSIS
            enable-organization-admin-account
          --account-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the account to  desig-
          nate as the Detective administrator account for the organization.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
