NAME
       invalidation-completed -

DESCRIPTION
       Wait until an invalidation has completed. It will poll every 20 seconds
       until a successful state has been reached. This will exit with a return
       code of 255 after 30 failed checks.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            invalidation-completed
          --distribution-id <value>
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --distribution-id (string)
          The distribution's ID.

       --id (string)
          The  identifier  for  the  invalidation  request, for example, IDFD-
          VBD632BHDS5 .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
