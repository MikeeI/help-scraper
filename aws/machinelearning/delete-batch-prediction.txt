DESCRIPTION
       Assigns  the  DELETED  status to a BatchPrediction , rendering it unus-

       BatchPrediction operation to verify that the status of the BatchPredic-
       tion changed to DELETED.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-batch-prediction
          --batch-prediction-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --batch-prediction-id (string)
          A user-supplied ID that uniquely identifies the BatchPrediction .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       BatchPredictionId -> (string)
          A user-supplied ID that uniquely identifies  the  BatchPrediction  .
          This value should be identical to the value of the BatchPredictionID
          in the request.
