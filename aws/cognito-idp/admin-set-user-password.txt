ADMIN-SET-USER-PASSWORD()                            ADMIN-SET-USER-PASSWORD()



NAME
       admin-set-user-password -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the specified user's password in a user pool as an administrator.
       Works on any user.

       The password can be temporary or permanent. If  it  is  temporary,  the
       user  status enters the FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD state. When the user next
       tries to sign in, the InitiateAuth/AdminInitiateAuth response will con-
       tain  the  NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED challenge. If the user doesn't sign in
       before it expires, the user won't be able to sign in, and  an  adminis-
       trator must reset their password.

       Once the user has set a new password, or the password is permanent, the
       user status is set to Confirmed .

SYNOPSIS
            admin-set-user-password
          --user-pool-id <value>
          --username <value>
          --password <value>
          [--permanent | --no-permanent]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool where you want to set the  user's
          password.

       --username (string)
          The user name of the user whose password you want to set.

       --password (string)
          The password for the user.

       --permanent | --no-permanent (boolean)
          True if the password is permanent, False if it is temporary.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
