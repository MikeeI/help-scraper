SYNOPSIS
            create-resource-server
          --user-pool-id <value>
          --identifier <value>
          --name <value>
          [--scopes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool.

       --identifier (string)
          A unique resource server identifier for the  resource  server.  This
          could  be  an  HTTPS  endpoint where the resource server is located,
          such as https://my-weather-api.example.com .

       --name (string)
          A friendly name for the resource server.

       --scopes (list)
          A list of scopes. Each scope is a key-value map with the  keys  name
          and description .

          (structure)
              A resource server scope.

              ScopeName -> (string)
                 The name of the scope.

              ScopeDescription -> (string)
                 A description of the scope.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ScopeName=string,ScopeDescription=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ScopeName": "string",
              "ScopeDescription": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
