DESCRIPTION
       Gets the user pool multi-factor authentication (MFA) configuration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-user-pool-mfa-config
          --user-pool-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SmsMfaConfiguration -> (structure)
          The SMS text message multi-factor (MFA) configuration.

          SmsAuthenticationMessage -> (string)
              The SMS authentication message that will be sent to  users  with
              the  code they must sign in. The message must contain the {####}
              placeholder, which is replaced with the  code.  If  the  message
              isn't included, and default message will be used.

          SmsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The SMS configuration.

              SnsCallerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS caller. This
                 is the ARN of the IAM role in your Amazon  Web  Services  ac-
                 count  that Amazon Cognito will use to send SMS messages. SMS
                 messages are subject to a spending limit .

              ExternalId -> (string)
                 The external ID is a value that you should use to  add  secu-
                 rity to your IAM role that is used to call Amazon SNS to send
                 SMS messages for your user pool. If you provide an ExternalId
                 ,  the Amazon Cognito User Pool will include it when attempt-
                 ing to assume your IAM role so that you can  set  your  roles
                 trust  policy to require the ExternalID . If you use the Ama-
                 zon Cognito Management Console  to  create  a  role  for  SMS
                 multi-factor authentication (MFA), Amazon Cognito will create
                 a role with the required permissions and a trust policy  that
                 demonstrates use of the ExternalId .

                 For  more information about the ExternalId of a role, see How
                 to use an external ID when granting access to your Amazon Web
                 Services resources to a third party

       SoftwareTokenMfaConfiguration -> (structure)
