SYNOPSIS
            describe-entity-aggregates
          [--event-arns <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --event-arns (list)
          A  list  of  event   ARNs   (unique   identifiers).   For   example:
          "arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHED-
          ULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED_ABC123-CDE456",
          "arn:aws:health:us-west-1::event/EBS/AWS_EBS_LOST_VOL-
          UME/AWS_EBS_LOST_VOLUME_CHI789_JKL101"

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       entityAggregates -> (list)
          The  number  of  entities that are affected by each of the specified
          events.

          (structure)
              The number of entities that are affected by one or more  events.
              Returned by the DescribeEntityAggregates operation.

              eventArn -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the event. The event ARN has the
                 ``
                 arn:aws:health:event-region  ::event/SERVICE /EVENT_TYPE_CODE
                 /EVENT_TYPE_PLUS_ID `` format.

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 100)
                        Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                        For example, an event ARN might look like the  follow-
                        ing:
                     arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIRE-
                     MENT_SCHEDULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHED-
                     ULED_ABC123-DEF456

              count -> (integer)
                 The number of entities that match the criteria for the speci-
                 fied events.
