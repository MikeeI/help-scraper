NAME
       get-compatible-elasticsearch-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of upgrade compatible Elastisearch versions. You can op-
       tionally pass a ``  DomainName `` to get all upgrade  compatible  Elas-
       ticsearch versions for that specific domain.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-compatible-elasticsearch-versions
          [--domain-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The  name of an Elasticsearch domain. Domain names are unique across
          the domains owned by an account within an AWS region.  Domain  names
          start  with a letter or number and can contain the following charac-
          ters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CompatibleElasticsearchVersions -> (list)
          A  map  of compatible Elasticsearch versions returned as part of the
          ``  GetCompatibleElasticsearchVersions `` operation.

          (structure)
              A map from an ``  ElasticsearchVersion `` to a list of  compati-
              ble ``  ElasticsearchVersion `` s to which the domain can be up-
              graded.

              SourceVersion -> (string)
                 The current version of Elasticsearch on which a domain is.

              TargetVersions -> (list)
                 List of supported elastic search versions.

                 (string)
