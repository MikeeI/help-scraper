DESCRIPTION

       bucket.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-export
          --export-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --export-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the export to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       exportId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the deleted export.

       exportStatus -> (string)
          The  current  status of the deletion. When the deletion is complete,
          the export will no longer be returned by the  ListExports  operation
          and calls to the DescribeExport operation with the export identifier
          will fail.
