RESOLVE-CUSTOMER()                                          RESOLVE-CUSTOMER()



NAME
       resolve-customer -

DESCRIPTION
          ResolveCustomer is called by a SaaS application during the registra-
          tion process. When a buyer visits your website during the  registra-
          tion  process,  the buyer submits a registration token through their
          browser. The registration token is resolved through this API to  ob-
          tain  a  CustomerIdentifier  along with the CustomerAWSAccountId and
          ProductCode .

       NOTE:
          The API needs to called from the seller account id used  to  publish
          the SaaS application to successfully resolve the token.

          For  an  example of using ResolveCustomer , see ResolveCustomer code
          example in the AWS Marketplace Seller Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            resolve-customer
          --registration-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registration-token (string)
          When a buyer visits your website during  the  registration  process,
          the buyer submits a registration token through the browser. The reg-
          istration token is resolved to  obtain  a  CustomerIdentifier  along
          with the CustomerAWSAccountId and ProductCode .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CustomerIdentifier -> (string)
          The CustomerIdentifier is used to identify an individual customer in
          your  application.  Calls to BatchMeterUsage require CustomerIdenti-
          fiers for each UsageRecord .

       ProductCode -> (string)
          The product code is returned to confirm that the buyer is  register-
          ing  for  your  product.  Subsequent BatchMeterUsage calls should be
          made using this product code.

       CustomerAWSAccountId -> (string)
          The CustomerAWSAccountId provides the AWS account ID associated with
          the CustomerIdentifier for the individual customer.
