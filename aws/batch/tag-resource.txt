TAG-RESOURCE()                                                  TAG-RESOURCE()



NAME
       tag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  the  specified  tags  to  a resource with the specified re-
       sourceArn . If existing tags on a resource aren't specified in the  re-
       quest  parameters, they aren't changed. When a resource is deleted, the
       tags that are associated with that resource are deleted as well.  Batch
       resources that support tags are compute environments, jobs, job defini-
       tions, job queues, and scheduling policies. ARNs for child jobs of  ar-
       ray and multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs are not supported.

SYNOPSIS
            tag-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that tags are added
          to. Batch resources that  support  tags  are  compute  environments,
          jobs, job definitions, job queues, and scheduling policies. ARNs for
          child jobs of array and multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs are not  sup-
          ported.

       --tags (map)
          The  tags  that you apply to the resource to help you categorize and
          organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an  optional
          value.  For  more  information,  see Tagging Amazon Web Services Re-
          sources in Amazon Web Services General Reference .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
