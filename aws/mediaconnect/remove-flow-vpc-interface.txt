REMOVE-FLOW-VPC-INTERFACE()                        REMOVE-FLOW-VPC-INTERFACE()



NAME
       remove-flow-vpc-interface -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes a VPC Interface from an existing flow. This request can be made
       only on a VPC interface that does not have a Source or  Output  associ-
       ated with it. If the VPC interface is referenced by a Source or Output,
       you must first delete or update the Source or Output to no longer  ref-
       erence the VPC interface.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            remove-flow-vpc-interface
          --flow-arn <value>
          --vpc-interface-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --flow-arn  (string)  The  flow that you want to remove a VPC interface
       from.

       --vpc-interface-name (string) The name of the VPC  interface  that  you
       want to remove.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FlowArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the flow that is associated with the  VPC  interface  you
          removed.

       NonDeletedNetworkInterfaceIds -> (list)
          IDs  of network interfaces associated with the removed VPC interface
          that Media Connect was unable to remove.
