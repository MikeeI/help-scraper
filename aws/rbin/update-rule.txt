       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-rule
          --identifier <value>
          [--retention-period <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          [--resource-type <value>]
          [--resource-tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identifier (string)
          The unique ID of the retention rule.

       --retention-period (structure)
          Information  about the retention period for which the retention rule
          is to retain resources.

          RetentionPeriodValue -> (integer)
              The period value for which the retention rule is to  retain  re-
              sources. The period is measured using the unit specified for Re-
              tentionPeriodUnit .

          RetentionPeriodUnit -> (string)
              The unit of time in which the retention period is measured. Cur-
              rently, only DAYS is supported.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RetentionPeriodValue=integer,RetentionPeriodUnit=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RetentionPeriodValue": integer,
            "RetentionPeriodUnit": "DAYS"
          }

       --description (string)
          The retention rule description.

       --resource-type (string)
          The  resource  type to be retained by the retention rule. Currently,
          only Amazon EBS snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs are supported. To  re-
          tain  snapshots,  specify  EBS_SNAPSHOT . To retain EBS-backed AMIs,
          specify EC2_IMAGE .

          Possible values:

          o EBS_SNAPSHOT

          o EC2_IMAGE

       --resource-tags (list)
          Specifies the resource tags to use to identify resources that are to
          be  retained  by a tag-level retention rule. For tag-level retention
          rules, only deleted resources, of the specified resource type,  that
          have  one  or  more of the specified tag key and value pairs are re-
          tained. If a resource is deleted, but it does not have  any  of  the
          specified tag key and value pairs, it is immediately deleted without
          being retained by the retention rule.

          You can add the same tag key and value pair to a maximum or five re-
          tention rules.

          To  create a Region-level retention rule, omit this parameter. A Re-
          gion-level retention rule does not have any resource tags specified.
          It  retains  all deleted resources of the specified resource type in
          the Region in which the rule is created, even if the  resources  are
          not tagged.

          (structure)
              Information  about  the resource tags used to identify resources
              that are retained by the retention rule.

              ResourceTagKey -> (string)
                 The tag key.

              ResourceTagValue -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceTagKey=string,ResourceTagValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResourceTagKey": "string",
              "ResourceTagValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              tentionPeriodUnit .

          RetentionPeriodUnit -> (string)
