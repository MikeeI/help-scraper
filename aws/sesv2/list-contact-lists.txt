       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-contact-lists
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --page-size (integer)
          Maximum  number of contact lists to return at once. Use this parame-
          ter to paginate results. If additional contact  lists  exist  beyond
          the  specified limit, the NextToken element is sent in the response.
          Use the NextToken value in subsequent  requests  to  retrieve  addi-
          tional lists.

       --next-token (string)
          A  string  token  indicating  that there might be additional contact
          lists available to be listed. Use the token provided in the Response
          to  use in the subsequent call to ListContactLists with the same pa-
          rameters to retrieve the next page of contact lists.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ContactLists -> (list)
          The available contact lists.

          (structure)
              A list that contains contacts that have subscribed to a particu-
              lar topic or topics.

              ContactListName -> (string)
                 The name of the contact list.

              LastUpdatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp noting the last time the  contact  list  was  up-
                 dated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  string  token  indicating  that there might be additional contact
          lists available to be listed. Copy this token to a  subsequent  call
          to  ListContactLists  with  the same parameters to retrieve the next
          page of contact lists.
