GET-FILE-UPLOAD-URL()                                    GET-FILE-UPLOAD-URL()



NAME
       get-file-upload-url -

DESCRIPTION
       The  GetFileUploadURL  operation generates and returns a temporary URL.
       You use the temporary URL to retrieve a file uploaded by a Worker as an
       answer  to  a FileUploadAnswer question for a HIT. The temporary URL is
       generated the instant the GetFileUploadURL operation is called, and  is
       valid  for 60 seconds. You can get a temporary file upload URL any time
       until the HIT is disposed. After the  HIT  is  disposed,  any  uploaded
       files  are deleted, and cannot be retrieved. Pending Deprecation on De-
       cember 12, 2017. The Answer Specification structure will no longer sup-
       port  the FileUploadAnswer element to be used for the QuestionForm data
       structure. Instead, we recommend that Requesters  who  want  to  create
       HITs asking Workers to upload files to use Amazon S3.

SYNOPSIS
            get-file-upload-url
          --assignment-id <value>
          --question-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assignment-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the assignment that contains the question with a FileU-
          ploadAnswer.

       --question-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the question with a FileUploadAnswer, as specified
          in the QuestionForm of the HIT.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
