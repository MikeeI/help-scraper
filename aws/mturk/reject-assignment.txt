REJECT-ASSIGNMENT()                                        REJECT-ASSIGNMENT()



NAME
       reject-assignment -

DESCRIPTION
       The  RejectAssignment  operation rejects the results of a completed as-
       signment.

       You can include an optional feedback message with the rejection,  which
       the  Worker can see in the Status section of the web site. When you in-
       clude a feedback message with the rejection, it helps the Worker under-
       stand  why  the assignment was rejected, and can improve the quality of
       the results the Worker submits in the future.

       Only the Requester who created the HIT can reject an assignment for the
       HIT.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            reject-assignment
          --assignment-id <value>
          --requester-feedback <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assignment-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the assignment. The assignment must correspond to a HIT
          created by the Requester.

       --requester-feedback (string)
          A message for the Worker, which the Worker can  see  in  the  Status
          section of the web site.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
