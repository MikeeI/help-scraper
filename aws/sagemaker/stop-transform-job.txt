NAME
       stop-transform-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops a batch transform job.

       When  Amazon  SageMaker receives a StopTransformJob request, the status
       of the job changes to Stopping . After Amazon SageMaker stops the  job,
       the  status is set to Stopped . When you stop a batch transform job be-
       fore it is completed, Amazon SageMaker doesn't store the  job's  output
       in Amazon S3.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-transform-job
          --transform-job-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transform-job-name (string)
          The name of the batch transform job to stop.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
