DESCRIPTION

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-scenes
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          --workspace-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the maximum number of results to display.

       --next-token (string)
          The string that specifies the next page of results.

       --workspace-id (string)
          The ID of the workspace that contains the scenes.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
