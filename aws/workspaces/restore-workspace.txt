RESTORE-WORKSPACE()                                        RESTORE-WORKSPACE()



NAME
       restore-workspace -

DESCRIPTION
       Restores the specified WorkSpace to its last known healthy state.

       You  cannot restore a WorkSpace unless its state is AVAILABLE , ERROR ,
       UNHEALTHY , or STOPPED .

       Restoring a WorkSpace is a potentially destructive action that can  re-
       sult in the loss of data. For more information, see Restore a WorkSpace
       .

       This operation is asynchronous and returns before the WorkSpace is com-
       pletely restored.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            restore-workspace
          --workspace-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workspace-id (string)
          The identifier of the WorkSpace.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
