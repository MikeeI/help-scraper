NAME
       get-recommender-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about  all the recommender model configurations
       that are associated with your Amazon Pinpoint account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-recommender-configurations
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --page-size (string)
          The maximum number of items to include in each page of  a  paginated
          response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign,
          and journey metrics.

       --token (string)
          The NextToken string that specifies which page of results to  return
          in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ListRecommenderConfigurationsResponse -> (structure)
          Provides information about all the recommender model  configurations
          that are associated with your Amazon Pinpoint account.

          Item -> (list)
              An array of responses, one for each recommender model configura-
              tion that's associated with your Amazon Pinpoint account.

              (structure)
                 Provides information about Amazon Pinpoint configuration set-
                 tings  for  retrieving and processing data from a recommender
                 model.

                 Attributes -> (map)
                     A map that defines  1-10  custom  endpoint  or  user  at-
                     tributes,  depending on the value for the Recommendation-
                     ProviderIdType property. Each of these attributes  tempo-
                     rarily  stores  a  recommended item that's retrieved from
                     the recommender model and sent to an AWS Lambda  function
                     for  additional processing. Each attribute can be used as
                     a message variable in a message template.

                     This value is null if the configuration doesn't invoke an
                     AWS  Lambda  function  (RecommendationTransformerUri)  to
                     perform additional processing of recommendation data.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 CreationDate -> (string)
                     The date, in extended ISO 8601 format, when the  configu-
                     ration was created for the recommender model.

                 Description -> (string)
                     The  custom description of the configuration for the rec-
                     ommender model.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for the recommender model  configu-
                     ration.

                 LastModifiedDate -> (string)
                     The  date, in extended ISO 8601 format, when the configu-
                     ration for the recommender model was last modified.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The custom name of the configuration for the  recommender
                     model.

                 RecommendationProviderIdType -> (string)
                     The  type  of  Amazon  Pinpoint ID that's associated with
                     unique user IDs in the recommender model. This value  en-
                     ables  the  model  to  use attribute and event data thats
                     specific to a particular endpoint or user  in  an  Amazon
                     Pinpoint application. Possible values are:

                     o PINPOINT_ENDPOINT_ID  - Each user in the model is asso-
                       ciated with a particular endpoint in  Amazon  Pinpoint.
                       The  data is correlated based on endpoint IDs in Amazon
                       Pinpoint. This is the default value.

                     o PINPOINT_USER_ID - Each user in the model is associated
                       with a particular user and endpoint in Amazon Pinpoint.
                       The data is correlated based on user IDs in Amazon Pin-
                       point.  If this value is specified, an endpoint defini-
                       tion in Amazon Pinpoint has to specify both a  user  ID
                       (UserId)  and  an endpoint ID. Otherwise, messages wont
                       be sent to the user's endpoint.

                 RecommendationProviderRoleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  AWS  Identity  and
                     Access  Management (IAM) role that authorizes Amazon Pin-
                     point to retrieve recommendation  data  from  the  recom-
                     mender model.

                 RecommendationProviderUri -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the recommender model
                     that Amazon Pinpoint retrieves  the  recommendation  data
                     from. This value is the ARN of an Amazon Personalize cam-
                     paign.

                 RecommendationTransformerUri -> (string)
                     The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS  Lambda
                     function  that  Amazon  Pinpoint invokes to perform addi-
                     tional processing of  recommendation  data  that  it  re-
                     trieves from the recommender model.

                 RecommendationsDisplayName -> (string)
                     The custom display name for the standard endpoint or user
                     attribute (RecommendationItems) that  temporarily  stores
                     recommended items for each endpoint or user, depending on
                     the value for the RecommendationProviderIdType  property.
                     This name appears in the Attribute finder of the template
                     editor on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

                     This value is null if the configuration doesn't invoke an
                     AWS  Lambda  function  (RecommendationTransformerUri)  to
                     perform additional processing of recommendation data.

                 RecommendationsPerMessage -> (integer)
                     The number of recommended items that are  retrieved  from
                     the  model  for  each  endpoint or user, depending on the
                     value for the RecommendationProviderIdType property. This
                     number  determines  how many recommended items are avail-
                     able for use in message variables.

          NextToken -> (string)
              The string to use in a subsequent request to get the  next  page
              of  results in a paginated response. This value is null if there
              are no additional pages.
