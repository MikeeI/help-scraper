NAME
       tag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  a  given  tag  to  a  resource  in your account. A tag is a
       key-value pair which can be added to an Amazon  Lookout  for  Equipment
       resource as metadata. Tags can be used for organizing your resources as
       well as helping you to search and filter by tag. Multiple tags  can  be
       added to a resource, either when you create it, or later. Up to 50 tags
       can be associated with each resource.

SYNOPSIS
            tag-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the specific resource to which the
          tag should be associated.

       --tags (list)
          The  tag or tags to be associated with a specific resource. Both the
          tag key and value are specified.

          (structure)
              A tag is a key-value pair that can be added  to  a  resource  as
              metadata.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the specified tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the specified tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
