LIST-CONNECTORS()                                            LIST-CONNECTORS()



NAME
       list-connectors -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the list of all registered custom connectors in your Amazon Web
       Services account. This API lists only custom connectors  registered  in
       this account, not the Amazon Web Services authored connectors.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-connectors
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the maximum number of items that should be returned in the
          result set. The default for maxResults is 20 (for all paginated  API
          operations).

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token for the next page of data.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
