SYNOPSIS
            register-connector
          [--connector-label <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          [--connector-provisioning-type <value>]
          [--connector-provisioning-config <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connector-label (string)
          The name of the connector. The name is unique for each ConnectorReg-
          istration in your Amazon Web Services account.

       --description (string)
          A description about the connector that's being registered.

       --connector-provisioning-type (string)
          The provisioning type of the connector. Currently the only supported
          value is LAMBDA.

          Possible values:

          o LAMBDA

       --connector-provisioning-config (structure)
          The provisioning type of the connector. Currently the only supported
          value is LAMBDA.

          lambda -> (structure)
              Contains information about the configuration of the lambda which
              is being registered as the connector.

              lambdaArn -> (string)
                 Lambda ARN of the connector being registered.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          lambda={lambdaArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "lambda": {
              "lambdaArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       connectorArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the connector being registered.
