DELETE-ENTITY-RECOGNIZER()                          DELETE-ENTITY-RECOGNIZER()



NAME
       delete-entity-recognizer -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an entity recognizer.

       Only  those  recognizers  that  are  in  terminated  states  (IN_ERROR,
       TRAINED) will be deleted. If an  active  inference  job  is  using  the
       model, a ResourceInUseException will be returned.

       This is an asynchronous action that puts the recognizer into a DELETING
       state, and it is then removed by a background job.  Once  removed,  the
       recognizer  disappears from your account and is no longer available for
       use.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-entity-recognizer
          --entity-recognizer-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --entity-recognizer-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that  identifies  the  entity  recog-
          nizer.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
