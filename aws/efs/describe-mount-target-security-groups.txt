DESCRIPTION

       This operation requires that the network interface of the mount  target
       has  been  created  and  the lifecycle state of the mount target is not
       deleted .

       This operation requires permissions for the following actions:

       o elasticfilesystem:DescribeMountTargetSecurityGroups  action  on   the
         mount target's file system.

       o ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaceAttribute  action  on  the mount target's
         network interface.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-mount-target-security-groups
          --mount-target-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --mount-target-id (string)
          The ID of the mount target whose security groups  you  want  to  re-
          trieve.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SecurityGroups -> (list)
          An array of security groups.

          (string)
