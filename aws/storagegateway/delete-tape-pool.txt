NAME
       delete-tape-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Delete  a  custom  tape pool. A custom tape pool can only be deleted if
       there are no tapes in the pool and if there are no automatic tape  cre-
       ation policies that reference the custom tape pool.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-tape-pool
          --pool-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pool-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the custom tape pool to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PoolARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  custom  tape  pool  being
          deleted.
