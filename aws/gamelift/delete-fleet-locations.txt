DELETE-FLEET-LOCATIONS()                              DELETE-FLEET-LOCATIONS()



NAME
       delete-fleet-locations -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  locations  from  a multi-location fleet. When deleting a loca-
       tion, all game server process and all instances that are  still  active
       in the location are shut down.

       To  delete fleet locations, identify the fleet ID and provide a list of
       the locations to be deleted.

       If successful, GameLift sets the location status to DELETING , and  be-
       gins  to shut down existing server processes and terminate instances in
       each location  being  deleted.  When  completed,  the  location  status
       changes to TERMINATED .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-fleet-locations
          --fleet-id <value>
          --locations <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the fleet to delete locations for. You can
          use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --locations (list)
          The list of fleet locations to delete. Specify locations in the form
          of an AWS Region code, such as us-west-2 .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that location attributes are being
          deleted for.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift fleet
          resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all  Re-
          gions.           Format           is           arn:aws:gamelift:<re-
          gion>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912 .

       LocationStates -> (list)
          The remote locations that are being deleted, with each location sta-
          tus set to DELETING .

          (structure)
              A  fleet location and its life-cycle state. A location state ob-
              ject might be used to describe a fleet's remote location or home
              Region.  Life-cycle  state  tracks the progress of launching the
              first instance in a new location and preparing it for game host-
              ing,  and  then removing all instances and deleting the location
              from the fleet.
