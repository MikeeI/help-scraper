UNTAG-RESOURCE()                                              UNTAG-RESOURCE()



NAME
       untag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  a  tag  that is assigned to a GameLift resource. Resource tags
       are used to organize Amazon Web Services resources for a range of  pur-
       poses.  This operation handles the permissions necessary to manage tags
       for the following GameLift resource types:

       o Build

       o Script

       o Fleet

       o Alias

       o GameSessionQueue

       o MatchmakingConfiguration

       o MatchmakingRuleSet

       To remove a tag from a resource, specify the unique ARN value  for  the
       resource  and  provide  a string list containing one or more tags to be
       removed. This operation succeeds even if the list  includes  tags  that
       are not currently assigned to the specified resource.

SYNOPSIS
            untag-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          --tag-keys <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN ) that is assigned to and uniquely
          identifies the GameLift resource that you want to remove tags  from.
          GameLift  resource  ARNs are included in the data object for the re-
          source, which can be retrieved by calling a List or Describe  opera-
          tion for the resource type.

       --tag-keys (list)
          A list of one or more tag keys to remove from the specified GameLift
          resource. An Amazon Web Services resource can have only one tag with
          a  specific  tag key, so specifying the tag key identifies which tag
          to remove.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
