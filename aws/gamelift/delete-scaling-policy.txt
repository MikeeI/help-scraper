DELETE-SCALING-POLICY()                                DELETE-SCALING-POLICY()



NAME
       delete-scaling-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  fleet scaling policy. Once deleted, the policy is no longer
       in force and GameLift removes all record of it.  To  delete  a  scaling
       policy, specify both the scaling policy name and the fleet ID it is as-
       sociated with.

       To temporarily suspend scaling policies, call  StopFleetActions .  This
       operation suspends all policies for the fleet.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-scaling-policy
          --name <value>
          --fleet-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A descriptive label that is associated with a fleet's  scaling  pol-
          icy. Policy names do not need to be unique.

       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique identifier for the fleet to be deleted. You can use either
          the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
