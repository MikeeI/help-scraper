NAME
       delete-backup-vault-lock-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  Backup  Vault  Lock  from a backup vault specified by a backup
       vault name.

       If the Vault Lock configuration is immutable, then  you  cannot  delete
       Vault Lock using API operations, and you will receive an InvalidReques-
       tException if you attempt to do so. For  more  information,  see  Vault
       Lock in the Backup Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-backup-vault-lock-configuration
          --backup-vault-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-vault-name (string)
          The name of the backup vault from which to delete Backup Vault Lock.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
