NAME
       get-profile-object-type-template -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the template information for a specific object type.

       A  template  is  a predefined ProfileObjectType, such as Salesforce-Ac-
       count or Salesforce-Contact. When a user sends a  ProfileObject,  using
       the  PutProfileObject  API,  with an ObjectTypeName that matches one of
       the TemplateIds, it uses the mappings from the template.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-profile-object-type-template
          --template-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --template-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the object template.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TemplateId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the object template.

       SourceName -> (string)
          The name of the source of the object template.

       SourceObject -> (string)
          The source of the object template.

       AllowProfileCreation -> (boolean)
          Indicates  whether a profile should be created when data is received
          if one doesnt exist for an object of this type. The default is FALSE
          .  If  the AllowProfileCreation flag is set to FALSE , then the ser-
          vice tries to fetch a standard profile  and  associate  this  object
          with  the  profile. If it is set to TRUE , and if no match is found,
          then the service creates a new standard profile.

       SourceLastUpdatedTimestampFormat -> (string)
          The format of your sourceLastUpdatedTimestamp  that  was  previously
          set up.

       Fields -> (map)
          A map of the name and ObjectType field.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents a field in a ProfileObjectType.

              Source -> (string)
                 A  field  of a ProfileObject. For example: _source.FirstName,
                 where _source is a ProfileObjectType of a  Zendesk  user  and
                 FirstName is a field in that ObjectType.

              Target -> (string)
                 The location of the data in the standard ProfileObject model.
                 For example: _profile.Address.PostalCode.

              ContentType -> (string)
                 The content type of the field. Used for determining  equality
                 when searching.

       Keys -> (map)
          A list of unique keys that can be used to map data to the profile.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (structure)
                 An  object that defines the Key element of a ProfileObject. A
                 Key is a special element that can be used  to  search  for  a
                 customer profile.

                 StandardIdentifiers -> (list)
                     The  types  of  keys  that a ProfileObject can have. Each
                     ProfileObject can have only 1  UNIQUE  key  but  multiple
                     PROFILE  keys.  PROFILE, ASSET, CASE, or ORDER means that
                     this key can be used to tie an object to a  PROFILE,  AS-
                     SET,  CASE,  or  ORDER respectively. UNIQUE means that it
                     can be used to uniquely identify an object. If a key a is
                     marked  as  SECONDARY, it will be used to search for pro-
                     files after all other PROFILE keys have been searched.  A
                     LOOKUP_ONLY  key  is  only used to match a profile but is
                     not persisted to be used for searching of the profile.  A
                     NEW_ONLY key is only used if the profile does not already
                     exist before the object is ingested, otherwise it is only
                     used for matching objects to profiles.

                     (string)

                 FieldNames -> (list)
                     The reference for the key name of the fields map.

                     (string)
